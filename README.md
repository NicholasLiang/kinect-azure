Check out [my kinect2 library](https://github.com/wouterverweirder/kinect2) for the Kinect v2 sensor.

## Installation

Make sure you have the Azure Kinect drivers and the [Azure Kinect Body SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/kinect-dk/body-sdk-download) installed.

The Body Tracking SDK relies on quite a few dll & onnx files, which you can find in the `Azure Kinect Body SDK\tools` directory. Either add that folder (eg C:\Program Files\Azure Kinect Body Tracking SDK\tools) to your PATH or copy the dll and onnx files into the root of your project.

Just npm install like you would do with any regular module. 

```
$ npm install kinect-azure
```

## Examples

There are nodejs and electron examples in the examples/ folder of this repo. To run them, execute npm install and npm start:

```
$ cd examples/electron
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The electron examples have the javascript code inside the html files. You can find these html files in [examples/electron/renderer/demos](examples/electron/renderer/demos).
