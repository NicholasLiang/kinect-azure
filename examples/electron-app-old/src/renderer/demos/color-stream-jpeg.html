            This demo shows the color stream in an image element. The default color stream is a buffer with jpeg data. Note that
            the img tag in this demo is resized through css to fit the window. The native image size in this demo is <spanid="info">larger</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most resolutions support a 30fps stream. Only the largest resolution (KinectAzure.K4A_COLOR_RESOLUTION_3072P) is
            limited to 15fps.
